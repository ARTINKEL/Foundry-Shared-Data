{"_id":"0heLkUZoR6DZCHET","name":"Artificer","permission":{"default":0,"EwniMIlnxy7gRcHL":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A gnome sits hunched over a workbench, carefully using needle and thread to wave runes into a leather satchel. The bag shudders as she completes her work, and a sudden, loud pop echoes through the room as a portal to an extradimensional space springs to being in the bag&rsquo;s interior. She beams with pride at her newly crafted bag of holding. A troll growls in hunger as it looms over a dwarf, who slides a long, metal tube from a holster at his belt. With a thunderous roar, a gout of flame erupts from the tube, and the troll&rsquo;s growls turn into shrieks of panic as it turns to flee. An elf scrambles up the castle&rsquo;s wall, Baron von Hendriks&rsquo; men close behind her. As she clambers over the battlements, she reaches into her satchel, pulls out three vials, mixes their contents into a small leather bag, and flings it at her pursuers. The bag bursts at their feet, trapping them in a thick, black glue as she makes her escape. Makers of magic-infused objects, artificers are defined by their inventive nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of study and investigation. Artificers, though, focus on creating marvelous new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and temporary for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft durable, useful items.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CUNNING INVENTORS</h3>\n<p>Every artificer is defined by a specific craft. Artificers see mastering the basic methods of a craft as the first step to true progress, the invention of new methods and approaches. Some artificers are engineers, students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms that they can augment with magic. Other artificers are alchemists. Using their knowledge of magic and various exotic ingredients, they create potions and draughts to aid them on their adventures. Alchemy and engineering are the two most common areas of study for artificers, but others do exist. All artificers are united by their curiosity and inventive nature. To an artificer, magic is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year. Artificers value novelty and discovery. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure. A hidden ruin might hold a forgotten magic item or a beautifully crafted mirror perfect for magical enhancement. Artificers win respect and renown among their kind by uncovering new lore or inventing new methods of creation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>INTENSE RIVALRIES</h3>\n<p>The artificers&rsquo; drive to invent and expand their knowledge creates an intense drive to uncover new magic discoveries. An artificer who hears news of a newly discovered magic item must act fast to get it before any rivals do. Good-aligned artificers recover items on adventures or offer gold or wondrous items to those who possess items they are keen to own. Evil ones have no problem committing crimes to claim what they want. Almost every artificer has at least one rival, someone whom they seek to outdo at every turn. By the same token, artificers with similar philosophies and theories band together into loose guilds. They share their discoveries and work together to verify their theories and keep ahead of their rivals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CREATING AN ARTIFICER</h3>\n<p>When creating an artificer character, think about your character&rsquo;s background and drive for adventure. Does the character have a rival? What is the character&rsquo;s relationship with the artisan or artificer who taught the basics of the craft? Talk to your DM about the role played by artificers in the campaign, and what sort of organizations and NPCs you might have ties to.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong>HIT POINTS</strong></h3>\n<p><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Dice:</strong>&nbsp;1d8 per artificer level<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;8 + your Constitution modifier<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong>&nbsp;1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong>PROFICIENCIES</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Armor:</strong>&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Weapons:</strong>&nbsp;Simple weapons, Hand Crossbows, Heavy Crossbows, Firearms<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tools:</strong>&nbsp;Thieves' Tools, Tinker Tools, and two others of your choice.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Saving Throws:</strong>&nbsp;Constitution, Intelligence<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Skills:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Choose three from Arcana, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Religion, Sleight </span></span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">of Hand.</span></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong>EQUIPMENT</strong></h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Light crossbow and 20 bolts or any two simple weapons</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Scale mail, leather armor, or chain mail</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Thieves' tools and Dungeoneer's Pack</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ARTIFICER'S SPECIALIZATION</strong></h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You focus your craft on a particular specialization: Gadgetsmith, Potionsmith, Thundersmith, or</p>\n<p>Warsmith each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 5th, and 14th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>MAGIC ITEM ANALYSIS</strong></h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your understanding of magic items allows you to analyze and understand their secrets. You know the artificer spells Detect Magic and Identify, and you can cast them as rituals without material components.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>TOOL EXPERTISE</strong></h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses any of the tool proficiencies you gain from this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ARCANE RETROFIT</strong></h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Additionally, at 2nd level, you gain the ability to retrofit magical gear. During a long rest you can perform a ritual using any +1/2/3 weapon (excluding artifacts and sentient weapons) to transfer the magic into an artificer weapon (a weapon created by subclass feature or upgrade). E.g.: you can turn a +1 longsword and your impact gauntlet into a +1 impact gauntlet. This includes weapon-like Upgrades that make attack and damage rolls (like a Warsmith's Force Blast).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You cannot transfer any properties from a magical weapon besides a bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the original weapon is destroyed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can convert a set of armor with a magical plus to AC to a lighter armor type.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>SPELLCASTING</strong></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>As part of your study of magic, you gain the ability to cast spells at 3rd level. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned with modifying creatures and objects or creating items.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELL SLOTS</strong></h3>\n<p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells you must expend a slot of their spells level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER</strong></h3>\n<p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Artificer spell list. The spells known column of the Artificer table shows when you learn more artificer spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Artificer table.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the artificer spells you know from this feature and replace it with another spell from the artificer spell list. The new spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots on the artificer table.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</strong></h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence Modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you can cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Save DC</strong> = 8 + Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Intelligence Modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Attack Modifier </strong>= Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Intelligence Modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>SPECIALIZATION UPGRADE</strong></h2>\n<p><em>3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your expert craftsmanship allows you to improve, modify, or add to your specialization's features.</p>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, choose an upgrade from the list at the end of your specialization, and gain the benefits listed in the description of the Upgrade.</p>\n<p>You select an additional Upgrade at 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th level. You cannot select an Upgrade more than once, unless the Upgrade's description says otherwise. Whenever you level up, you can exchange one of your existing upgrades for another upgrade of the same level requirement as the replaced upgrade.</p>\n<p>In any case that a specialization allows an Upgrade to be swapped out, Upgrades must always be selected as if the Artificer is the level they were when they got that Upgrade slot. For example, if you replace your Stormforged Weapon and reselect all of your upgrades as a 5th level Artificer, you could select one 3rd level upgrade and one 5th level upgrade, or two 3rd level upgrades, but you would not be able to select two 5th level upgrades.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT</strong></h2>\n<p><em>4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 18th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 18th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>You can also replace one of your skill proficiencies with a skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level (the proficiency you replace needn&rsquo;t be from the class). This represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ARCANE RECONSTRUCTION</strong></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You have mastered the knowledge of using magic to repair things. You learn the mending cantrip and can cast it at will. Additionally, you learn the cure wounds spell. If you already know cure wounds, you can select another spell from the artificer list. When you cast cure wounds, it can heal constructs in addition to normally valid targets.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>CROSS DISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE</strong></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You can expand on your knowledge across fields. You can craft one of the following: a Thundersmith's Stormforged Weapon, a Potionsmith's Alchemical Reagent Pouch and Alchemical Fire or Alchemical Acid, or an Unrestricted Gadgetsmith Upgrade.</p>\n<p>If you select a Stormforged Weapon, you gain proficiency with that weapon and knowledge of how to make ammunition for it (if required). You cannot apply Infused Weapon to another weapon granted by this class.</p>\n<p>If this selection is lost or destroyed, you can remake it following the rules for remaking the select item in subclass.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>WONDROUS ITEM PROFICIENCY</strong></h2>\n<p><em>7th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your familiarity with the workings of magical items means that you can ignore class-based restrictions on attuning to magical items. Additionally, you can now attune to 4 magical items at once.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>IMPROVED MAGICAL CRAFTING</strong></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your experience in creating your own wondrous invention makes you more adept at crafting a magic item than a normal spellcaster. Creating a magic item takes you half the time it would normally take.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can make 1 hour of progress toward crafting a magic item, scroll, or potion during a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>WONDROUS ITEM RECHARGE</strong></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You can recharge a magic item that has charges or per rest uses, as long as those charges or uses can only be used to cast spells. To restore charges or uses, you perform a ritual that takes one minute and expends a spell slot of equal or higher level than a spell slot level of a spell cast by the item.</p>\n<p>The number of charges or uses restored to the item is equal to the number of charges or uses required to cast that spell using the item once.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>STUDY OF MAGIC</strong></h2>\n<p><em>11th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your proficiency in the workings of magic has become so great you can cast detect magic and identify at will without expending a spell slot.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks to understand the workings of magical traps, effects, or runes.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>WONDROUS ITEMS MASTERY</strong></h2>\n<p><em>18th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You can activate a magic item that would normally take an action as a bonus action instead.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can attune to 5 magical items at a time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>PEERLESS INVENTOR</strong></h2>\n<p><em>20th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>At 20th level, your mind is always thinking of new options and clever solutions. You can select and create temporary version of an Upgrade from your subclass you are qualified to take but do not have with a level requirement of 11th level or lower as an action. You have this upgrade until you complete a short rest. You cannot select another temporary Upgrade in this fashion until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Artificer's Specialization</h1>\n<h2>Gadgetsmith</h2>\n<p>A Gadgetsmith is an Artificer whose curiosity and inventive genius have run rampant. While other Artificers may spend their whole career perfecting a single-minded pursuit, a Gadgetsmith believes that quantity is at least as good as quality.</p>\n<p>Quick footed and quicker witted, a Gadgetsmith is never caught without another trick up their sleeve. Their minds are always jumping ahead to solve the next problem with a clever gadget.</p>\n<p>A Gadgetsmith can come from any walk of life, but usually exemplifies a curiosity and distaste for the suppression of knowledge or technology, usually favoring freedom to experiment, leaning toward more Chaotic behaviors.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>GADGETSMITH'S PROFICIENCY</strong></h3>\n<p><em>1st-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with nets, rapiers, whips, and tinker's tools.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>ESSENTIAL TOOLS</strong></h3>\n<p><em>1st-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>You've mastered the creation of the essential reusable tools for surviving the battlefield as a gadgeteer. You have the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grappling Hook. As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or Smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it. Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it, however, this does not grapple it. Attacks of opportunity generated by this movement have disadvantage.</li>\n<li>Smoke Bomb. As an action, you can use this to cast fog cloud centered on yourself without expending a spell slot. It lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and does not require concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can set the radius at 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier per short rest.</li>\n<li>Gadgetsmith Weapon. Pick one of Impact Gauntlets, Lightning Baton, Repeating Crossbow, Ricocheting Weapon, or Shock Generator from the upgrade section. You receive this upgrade and it does not count against your upgrade total.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>ADDITIONAL UPGRADE</strong></h3>\n<p><em>3rd-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you've mastered the essential tools, and have begun to tinker with ways to expand your arsenal. The number of upgrades you have for your class level is increased by one.</p>\n<p>The number of additional upgrades you get increases by one more at 5th level to two more than the class table.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>RECYCLE GADGETS</strong></h3>\n<p><em>3rd-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>During a long rest and taking effect when you complete it, you can disassemble your gadgets and create different ones. When you do this, remove any upgrade you would like, and pick a new upgrade its place.</p>\n<p>You still must select upgrades that are valid for the level you gained the upgrade at (e.g. at 9th level, you can only have one upgrade that has a prerequisite of 9th level).</p>\n<p>Additionally, if a gadget is destroyed, you can use this feature to recreate it for materials worth 20 gold pieces.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>EXTRA ATTACK</strong></h3>\n<p><em>5th-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>COMBAT GADGETS</strong></h3>\n<p><em>14th-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>When you take the attack action, you can replace an attack with using any gadget that requires an action to use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LAEn6ZdC6lYUKhQ67Qk","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":3,"choices":[],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"half"},"flags":{},"img":"modules/foundry-shared-data/Images/artificer-icon.png","effects":[]}

For others, getting lost out in the world is an escape from the tangled web of debt or enemies they&rsquo;ve piled up. Other pugilists fight because it&rsquo;s the only thing they know how to do. Whatever the reason for their adventuring, pugilists are as excited by the prospect of throwing punches as they are spending every last gold coin they earn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CREATING A PUGILIST</h3>\n<p>As you build your pugilist, consider how you came to be a bare-knuckle brawler. Did you learn to fight to defend yourself? Was scraping the natural result of your nose for trouble? Or did you learn to fight as a way of intimidating and controlling others? Were you fighting for the entertainment, or did you fight because you had to? Did you try to become a more traditional martial artist but just couldn&rsquo;t hack it? Pugilists are a rowdy bunch that like to brag about how they learned to fight, so you better have a good story to tell. What events in your life gave you the sheer determination and will that pugilists call on? Did you spend every day hustling on the street to make ends meet? Were you forgotten and ignored by your family? Were you an outsider in your community who had to constantly struggle against the ignorant stereotypes the people there had of you? The most important element of the pugilist is that they are driven.

You may not use the finesse property of a weapon while using it as a pugilist weapon. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or using only pugilist weapons and you are wearing light or no armor and not using a shield:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or pugilist weapon. This die changes as you gain pugilist levels, as shown in the Fisticuffs column on the Pugilist table.</li>\n<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a pugilist weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike or grapple as a bonus action.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>IRON CHIN</strong></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you can use Constitution instead of Dexterity to determine your armor class when you are wearing light or no armor and are not using a shield.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>MOXIE</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your experience laying the beatdown on others has given you a moxie you can channel in the midst of battle. This swagger is represented by a number of moxie points. Your pugilist level determines the maximum number of points you have, as shown in the Moxie Points column of the Pugilist table.</p>\n<p>You can spend these points to fuel various moxie features. You start knowing three such features: Brace Up, The Old One-Two, and Stick and Move. You learn more moxie features as you gain levels in this class. You regain all expended moxie points when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3><strong>BRACE UP</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use a bonus action and spend 1 moxie point to brace for attacks. Roll your fisticuffs die + your pugilist level + your Constitution modifier and gain that many temporary hit points.</p>\n<h3><strong>THE OLD ONE-TWO</strong></h3>\n<p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 moxie point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3><strong>STICK AND MOVE</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use a bonus action and expend 1 moxie point to make a shove attack or take the Dash action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>STREET SMART</strong></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 2nd level, carousing, shadowboxing, and sparring all count as light activity for the purposes of resting for you. Additionally, once you have caroused in a settlement for 8 hours or more, you know all public locations in the city as if you were born and raised there and you cannot be lost by nonmagical means while within the city.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>BLOODIED BUT UNBOWED</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, when you take damage that reduces you to half your maximum hit points or less, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to your pugilist level + your Constitution modifier and you regain all expended moxie points. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>FIGHT CLUB</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you choose a fight club that best exemplifies your style: Arena Royale, Bloodhound Bruisers, Dog &amp; Hound, Piss &amp; Vinegar, the Squared Circle, or the Sweet Science, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your fight club grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT</strong></h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>You can also replace one of your skill proficiencies with a skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level (the proficiency you replace needn&rsquo;t be from the class). This represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>DIG DEEP</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, you discover a strength inside you that can&rsquo;t be broken. As a bonus action, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for one minute. At the end of that minute you gain a level of exhaustion.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>EXTRA ATTACK</strong></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>HAYMAKER</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, before you make an attack roll with an unarmed strike or pugilist melee weapon attack that does not already have disadvantage, you can declare you are swinging wild haymakers. You make all attack rolls until the end of this turn with disadvantage and when you deal damage you do not roll, but use the maximum die result instead.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>MOXIE-FUELED FISTS</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>FANCY FOOTWORK</strong></h2>\n<p>At 7th level, you gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>SHAKE IT OFF</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>DOWN BUT NOT OUT</strong></h2>\n<p>At 9th level, when you use your Bloodied but Unbowed feature you can choose to also use this feature. If you do, you add your proficiency bonus to your damage with unarmed attacks and pugilist weapons for the next minute. You can use this feature again after you complete a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS</strong></h2>\n<p>By 10th level, you&rsquo;ve graduated top of the class at the school of hard knocks and you took most of them on the head. You have resistance to psychic damage and gain advantage on saving throws against effects that would make you stunned or unconscious.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>RABBLE ROUSER</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, word of your exploits travels quickly in cities and other settlements. Once you have taken a long rest by carousing in a settlement, you gain advantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidation) rolls made against the people who live there.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>UNBREAKABLE</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, you gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 moxie point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>HERCULEAN</strong></h2>\n<p>At 15th level, your carrying capacity is doubled, and when you deal damage with a melee weapon or unarmed strike to an inanimate object that damage is doubled.

Each seeks to bring the others to heel. To ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the seven cities and every infernal thing that lives there, and lead an infinite army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn. Their elite shock troops, the terror-commandos of Hell, are the illriggers. Knights of Hell, they are charismatic counter-paladins who master devils, disrupt enemy organizations, and command Hell&rsquo;s armies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>THE ORDER OF DESOLATION</h3>\n<p>Millennia ago, the Lords of Hell did something remarkable: they cooperated. They came together to create the Order of Desolation, knights sworn to serve Hell first, their patron archdevil second.</p>\n<p>Acceptance into the Order of Desolation makes you a comrade with every other illrigger, regardless of which archdevil you serve. Each archdevil has churches, underground fanes, secret societies, cults. All with leaders manically devoted to the archdevil who grants them their power. But this association of illriggers consider themselves above the petty political squabbles that divide the seven cities.</p>\n<p>Members of the Order of Desolation, also known as the Desolate, are expected to be intelligent, resourceful, tactical, manipulative. A temple or cult might conclude that the presence of an illrigger in their midst is a sign that their archdevil approves of their actions, but the illriggers are independent. The order was founded to give the Lords of Hell agents capable of acting across the timescape, free from the direct control of their patron. An illrigger has many powerful abilities granted by their archdevil, but more precious is their patron&rsquo;s trust. Left to their own devices, the illrigger is expected to sow discord, pain, strife, deceit, and fear without instruction or supervision.</p>\n<p>It is not unusual, therefore, for a member of the Order of Desolation to rely on other members of the order first, even from illriggers who serve other archdevils, before going to any church, cult, or temple devoted to their own archdevil.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">HIT POINTS</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Dice:</strong>&nbsp;1d10 per illrigger level<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;10 + your Constitution modifier<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong>&nbsp;1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per illrigger level after 1st</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">PROFICIENCIES</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px; box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Armor:</strong>&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor, shields<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Weapons:</strong>&nbsp;Simple weapons, Martial weapons<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tools:</strong>&nbsp;None<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Saving Throws:</strong>&nbsp;Constitution, Charisma<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Skills:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Persuasion, </span></span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">and Religion</span></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">EQUIPMENT</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">(a) chain shirt or (b) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">(a) a priest&rsquo;s pack or (b) a dungeoneer&rsquo;s pack</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">A holy symbol, two daggers, and five javelins</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>FORKED TONGUE</strong></h2>\n<p>You have a facility with speech and know how to manipulate an audience. Whenever you make an ability check to persuade, deceive, or intimidate, you can treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as an 8.</p>\n<p>Additionally you learn the Infernal language.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>INFERNAL CONDUIT</strong></h2>\n<p>There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at 1st level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the Illrigger table. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.</p>\n<p>As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. If you miss, nothing happens&mdash;you do not roll or lose dice from your pool. If you hit, or if you&rsquo;re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.</p>\n<p>The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If you&rsquo;re touching an ally, they gain that many hit points, ignoring any hit points in excess of their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number of hit points they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you would gain hit points in excess of your maximum, you gain that number of temporary hit points instead.</p>\n<p>Beginning at 11th level, in addition to draining the life force of an enemy, you can also inflict one level of exhaustion on them. They may recover this exhaustion normally. This ability does not work if the target already has three or more levels of exhaustion, or if you have no dice left in your pool, and you cannot choose to inflict exhaustion instead of draining life.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>FIGHTING STYLE</strong></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose an illrigger fighting style:</p>\n<h3><strong>TREACHERY</strong></h3>\n<p>When you attack an enemy who has none of your allies adjacent to it, you gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls.</p>\n<h3><strong>BRAVADO</strong></h3>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n<h3><strong>SCHEMES</strong></h3>\n<p>While you wield a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you can use your reaction after an adjacent enemy attacks you to move into any other unoccupied space within five feet of the attacking enemy. This movement does not provoke an opportunity attack.</p>\n<h3><strong>LIES</strong></h3>\n<p>When you attack with a two-handed melee weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, for both the attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>BALEFUL INTERDICT</strong></h2>\n<p>When you reach 2nd level, you learn to use the power of Hell to censure other creatures. As a bonus action, you can place a seal on a target you can see within 30 feet. You can do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all your seals.</p>\n<p>When you or an ally hits a target you can see with any seals on it, you can consume the seals to make the attack deal an extra 2d6 necrotic damage to the target per seal consumed (This is not a reaction, it&rsquo;s free). If you are within 30 feet of the target, you regain 2 hit points for each die of damage your seals deals.</p>\n<p>A creature with a seal on them is an interdicted creature.</p>\n<p>Seals evaporate if not used after 1 minute. Only the illrigger who placed the seal knows it&rsquo;s there; it appears to the illrigger as a glowing glyph on the creature&rsquo;s forehead. If a creature with any of your seals on it dies, you can move all of its seals to another creature within range.</p>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you feel your connection to your archdevil increase. Your seals deal an extra 1d6 damage.</p>\n<p>Your seals improve differently based on which contract you choose. These improvements are listed under &ldquo;Diabolic Contract,&rdquo; below.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>HELLSIGHT</strong></h2>\n<p>When you reach 3rd level, your mastery of deception makes it easy for you to recognize the use of concealing sorcery. As an action, you extend your awareness out from you. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of creatures within 60 feet using magic to hide or disguise themselves.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>DIABOLIC CONTRACT</strong></h2>\n<p>When you reach 3rd level, you sign a diabolic contract with your archdevil who welcomes you into the Order of Desolation. You gain the Invoke Authority ability and choose either Painkiller (Dispater), Shadowmaster (Moloch), or Architect of Ruin (Asmodeus) as your archdevil.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, you are a noble knight in the lists of Hell and will be accorded fine treatment and hospitality anywhere in Hell you travel, even to cities ruled by enemy archdevils. More cosmopolitan cities in the timescape&mdash;like Alloy, the City of Brass&mdash;will also respect your noble rank.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>INVOKE AUTHORITY</strong></h2>\n<p>You invoke the authority granted you by your archdevil, channeling baleful energy to fuel magical effects. Each Invoke Authority option provided by your archdevil explains how to use it.</p>\n<p>When you use your Invoke Authority, you choose which option to use. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest to use it again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT</strong></h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>EXTRA ATTACK</strong></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>AURA OF DESPAIR</strong></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 14th level, you radiate a magical aura of evil. Whenever a hostile creature within 15 feet of you makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the result.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>SUMMON HELL</strong></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 15th level, as an action, you can summon a bone devil to serve you for 1 minute. The devil appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. It is bound to you and must obey your commands to the best of its ability. It acts on the same initiative that you act on, and may both act and move on the turn you summon it. If you die or fall unconscious, the devil returns to Hell. Once you use this feature, you must wait 1 week before you can use it again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>DIABOLIC CONTRACTS</strong></h2>\n<p>The knight who walks the path of Hell may gain access to the powers of the Illrigger purely through their own devotion. No oath is necessary, no mentor. A fledgling hellknight might not even be aware Hell&rsquo;s Paladins exist.</p>\n<p>But acceptance into the Order of Desolation at 3rd level means swearing an oath to a specific Lord of Hell and this usually requires a senior member of the order to perform an elaborate ritual. A dedicated knight, however, can attract the attention of one of the Infernal Dukes by doing deeds of great treachery on their own.</p>\n<p>Through ritual or deed, the young Illrigger eventually finds themselves face-to-face with one of the Lords of the Seven Cities&hellip;and the Contract must be signed. The contract that binds the itinerant knight to the Order and adds their names to the Lists of Hell. A contract signed in blood. Usually the knight&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>As intimidating an experience as this can be, the Lords of Hell are easy masters. They ask little from their chosen. Breaches of tenets are overlooked, as long as the knight sows discord and opposes the Celestial Host. The Dukes of the Seven Cities are busy and do not worry overmuch about the daily lives of their Illriggers.</p>\n<p>Indeed, this is what the order is for. Advancing Hell&rsquo;s agenda, independent of the current political climate of the Seven Cities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/illrigger-class","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":3,"choices":[],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"none"},"flags":{},"img":"modules/foundry-shared-data/Images/illrigger-icon.png","effects":[]}
{"_id":"jSlC4lDekJcHedG9","name":"Blood Hunter","permission":{"default":0,"EwniMIlnxy7gRcHL":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Marred but resolute, his grimacing face dripping with sweat, a half-orc reddens a finger across his wounds to draw a glowing, ruby glyph in the air. He grips the weightless, completed sigil, twisting it to unleash dark magical energies that fire forward, cursing the stalking behemoth from within its own veins to better even the odds.</p>\n<p>A mysterious half-elf swathed in a worn cloak and rugged leather armor carefully investigates a grizzly scene off the roadway, her eyes flashing with recognition as she meditates on the remnants of the massacre. The survivor who warily hired her withdraws with a jump as the half-elf suddenly shoots to her feet, sure in the knowledge of the culprit, where it calls home, and how little time there is to find it.</p>\n<p>Stepping into the lightless chambers of ancient dust and lingering whispers, the halfling&rsquo;s nose picks up the pungent smell of imminent danger as she hears the scraping of bone and claw on nearby stone. She winces as she runs her blade across her palm, the steel transmuting her blood into glowing runes of powerful magic, her sword suddenly engulfed in arcane flames, eager to brand and burn the flesh of her enemies.</p>\n<p>Often feared or misunderstood, and driven by an unending drive to destroy the wicked, blood hunters are clever, arcane warriors who have bound their essence to the dark creatures they hunt to better stalk and survive their prey. Armed with the rites of forbidden blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for the cause, they protect the realms from the shadows, ever vigilant to avoid becoming the same monsters they choose to hunt.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>SACRIFICE TO PRESERVE LIFE</h3>\n<p>While most of the classic schools of magical study are well known and widely respected, the less refined and macabre incantations of Hemocraft have long been forbidden and lost to most of the civilized world. Blood Hunters have reclaimed these techniques away from the judging eyes of society, finding blood magic&rsquo;s esoteric nature effffective against the evils that often defy the divine powers that historically hold the line.</p>\n<p>Through careful study and practice, blood hunters have honed the rites of hemocraft into their combat prowess, forfeiting a facet of their health to infuse their weapons with powerful blood magic and summoning the elements to envelop their strikes.</p>\n<p>They can sear an arcane brand into the body of their quarry that hinders their foe&rsquo;s abilities and punishes their aggression, or call blood curses upon their enemies, manipulating their bodies from the inside. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force against the terrors that threaten the innocent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>A MONSTER TO FIGHT MONSTERS</h3>\n<p>Whether driven by the wish to make a difference in a dangerous world, the need to take vengeance for a great wrong they have suffered, being inspired by witnessing the strange and powerful techniques of another blood hunter in person, or just seeking a place to belong in an uncaring world, the reasons one may take up the Hunter&rsquo;s Bane and choose this life are many and varied. In joining an order of blood hunters, one is also joining a tight family bound by service to each other and the common cause. For many, this is the only family they have known or have left, so the kinship felt between members of an order is a bond neigh unbreakable.</p>\n<p>Beyond the boundaries of the order, however, the life of a blood hunter is often not an easy one. The rituals of the Hunter&rsquo;s Bane regularly leave one visibly changed and prone to unsettle common folk, and the witnessing of hemocraft can invoke a superstitious fear from even the most learned scholar. While some societies have come to accept the good deeds of the orders, many blood hunters publicly hide their nature unless absolutely necessary, feeling more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world where the Orders commonly train. Even so, the best work a blood hunter can do usually involves the poor and defenseless on the outskirts of society, those prone to the corrupting touch of fiends and dark intension. Braving the threat of vilification, these dark protectors wade through civilization, earning coin as mercenaries or bounty hunters, ever watching for the signs of something more nefarious beneath the surface.</p>\n<p>In choosing this path, a blood hunter has irrevocably given a part of themselves to their cause, physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. The orders of blood hunters practice their own unique ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of these guardians. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle, so a life of discipline and vigilance drives their travels as they wander the countryside in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CREATING A BLOOD HUNTER</h3>\n<p>As you create a blood hunter, the most important aspects of your character are why you were driven to this lifestyle, and why do you seek to give up everything to wallow in the dark with the evils you hunt? Did you lose a loved one to a fiendish beast and now wish to prevent others from suffering the same fate? Do you seek a sense of purpose and security, and found this among the order that has taken you in? Have you always carried a seed of darkness within you, and seek kin to watch over you and prevent you succumbing to it? Were you once a holy warrior who strayed from his faith and was cast out, but still seek to give yourself to the cause of protecting the innocent? Or are you a criminal with a dark past seeking to make amends, taking this life as a path of penance?</p>\n<p>What is your relationship with the powers of hemocraft and the abilities it promises to grant you as you step closer to its mastery? Do you respect and fear the ancient power that surges through your veins, using them only when necessary? Do you relish in the strength it offers you, embracing your gifts and using them freely? Are you worried the superstitions are right, and this power will eventually turn you into one of the monsters you hunt? Or has your study instilled you with the confident control of mind over matter, certain you can bend these gifts to bring a brighter dawn?</p>\n<p>Consider too that while a blood hunter belongs to an order, many strike out on their own to do their best work. What made you leave the comfort of your order? Do you intend to return, or have you decided you have more to learn in the world beyond? What do you seek in other adventurers that can help you meet your goals?</p>\n<p>While most blood hunters follow a path of good or neutrality in their pursuits, some have fallen to the dark, seductive side of hemocraft and use their abilities for selfish and evil purposes. These deviants are always thrown from the order, and often hunted along with the creatures they once trained to fell.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">HIT POINTS</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per blood hunter level<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per blood hunter level after 1st</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">PROFICIENCIES</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px; box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, Martial weapons, Firearms<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tools:</strong> Alchemist&rsquo;s Supplies<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Skills:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Choose three from Athletics, Acrobatics, Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Religion, and </span></span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Survival</span></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">EQUIPMENT</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">A martial weapon or two simple weapons</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">A light crossbow and 20 bolts or hand crossbow and 20 bolts</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Studded leather armor or scale armor</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">An explorer&rsquo;s pack</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>HUNTER'S BANE</strong></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the Hunter&rsquo;s Bane, a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life&rsquo;s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.</p>\n<p>The Hunter&rsquo;s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities.

You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n<p>When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse&rsquo;s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>FIGHTING STYLE</strong></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can&rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h3><strong>ARCHERY</strong></h3>\n<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>\n<h3><strong>BLIND FIGHTING</strong></h3>\n<p>Being unable to see a creature doesn&rsquo;t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it, provided the creature isn&rsquo;t hidden from you.</p>\n<h3><strong>DUELING</strong></h3>\n<p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>\n<h3><strong>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING</strong></h3>\n<p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h3><strong>INTERCEPTION</strong></h3>\n<p>When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>\n<h3><strong>THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</strong></h3>\n<p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.</p>\n<h3><strong>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</strong></h3>\n<p>When you engage in two weapon fighting while wearing light or no armor, you do not expend your bonus action and add your ability modifier to the second attack. You can still gain the benefits of two weapon fighting once during your turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>UNARMED FIGHTING</strong></h3>\n<p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8. When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>MARTIAL VERSATILITY</strong></h2>\n<p>Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>CRIMSON RITE</strong></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality.</p>\n<p>Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list below to learn.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren&rsquo;t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table.</p>\n<p>While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite&rsquo;s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time.</p>\n<p>You learn an additional Primal Rite of your choice at 7th level, and choose an Esoteric Rite to learn at 14th level.</p>\n<h3><strong>PRIMAL RITES</strong></h3>\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rite of the Flame.

Your rite damage is necrotic damage.</li>\n<li>Rite of the Oracle. Your rite damage is psychic damage.</li>\n<li>Rite of the Roar. Your rite damage is thunder damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>BLOOD HUNTER ORDER</strong></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Mutant, Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, or Order of the Lycan, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT</strong></h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 18th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>You can also replace one of your skill proficiencies with a skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level (the proficiency you replace needn&rsquo;t be from the class). This represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>EXTRA ATTACK</strong></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>BRAND OF CASTIGATION</strong></h2>\n<p>At 6th level, whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature suffers psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</p>\n<p>Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell).</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>GRIM PSYCHOMETRY</strong></h2>\n<p>When you reach 9th level, you have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding</p>\n<p>mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and sometimes conveys visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>DARK AUGMENTATION</strong></h2>\n<p>Upon reaching 10th level, arcane blood magic suffuses your body, permanently reinforcing your resilience. Your speed increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>BRAND OF TETHERING</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation feature increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). In addition, a branded creature can&rsquo;t take the Dash action, and if a creature branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane shift fails.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>HARDENED SOUL</strong></h2>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, you can no longer become frightened, and you have advantage on saving throws against magical Charm effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>SANGUINE MASTERY</strong></h2>\n<p>Upon becoming 20th level, you honed your control over blood magic, mitigating your sacrifice and empowering your capability. Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":3,"choices":[],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"none"},"flags":{},"img":"modules/foundry-shared-data/Images/blood-hunter-icon.png","effects":[]}

{"_id":"jSlC4lDekJcHedG9","name":"Blood Hunter","permission":{"default":0,"EwniMIlnxy7gRcHL":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Marred but resolute, his grimacing face dripping with sweat, a half-orc reddens a finger across his wounds to draw a glowing, ruby glyph in the air. He grips the weightless, completed sigil, twisting it to unleash dark magical energies that fire forward, cursing the stalking behemoth from within its own veins to better even the odds.</p>\n<p>A mysterious half-elf swathed in a worn cloak and rugged leather armor carefully investigates a grizzly scene off the roadway, her eyes flashing with recognition as she meditates on the remnants of the massacre. The survivor who warily hired her withdraws with a jump as the half-elf suddenly shoots to her feet, sure in the knowledge of the culprit, where it calls home, and how little time there is to find it.</p>\n<p>Stepping into the lightless chambers of ancient dust and lingering whispers, the halfling&rsquo;s nose picks up the pungent smell of imminent danger as she hears the scraping of bone and claw on nearby stone. She winces as she runs her blade across her palm, the steel transmuting her blood into glowing runes of powerful magic, her sword suddenly engulfed in arcane flames, eager to brand and burn the flesh of her enemies.</p>\n<p>Often feared or misunderstood, and driven by an unending drive to destroy the wicked, blood hunters are clever, arcane warriors who have bound their essence to the dark creatures they hunt to better stalk and survive their prey. Armed with the rites of forbidden blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for the cause, they protect the realms from the shadows, ever vigilant to avoid becoming the same monsters they choose to hunt.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>SACRIFICE TO PRESERVE LIFE</h3>\n<p>While most of the classic schools of magical study are well known and widely respected, the less refined and macabre incantations of Hemocraft have long been forbidden and lost to most of the civilized world. Blood Hunters have reclaimed these techniques away from the judging eyes of society, finding blood magic&rsquo;s esoteric nature effffective against the evils that often defy the divine powers that historically hold the line.</p>\n<p>Through careful study and practice, blood hunters have honed the rites of hemocraft into their combat prowess, forfeiting a facet of their health to infuse their weapons with powerful blood magic and summoning the elements to envelop their strikes.</p>\n<p>They can sear an arcane brand into the body of their quarry that hinders their foe&rsquo;s abilities and punishes their aggression, or call blood curses upon their enemies, manipulating their bodies from the inside. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force against the terrors that threaten the innocent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>A MONSTER TO FIGHT MONSTERS</h3>\n<p>Whether driven by the wish to make a difference in a dangerous world, the need to take vengeance for a great wrong they have suffered, being inspired by witnessing the strange and powerful techniques of another blood hunter in person, or just seeking a place to belong in an uncaring world, the reasons one may take up the Hunter&rsquo;s Bane and choose this life are many and varied. In joining an order of blood hunters, one is also joining a tight family bound by service to each other and the common cause. For many, this is the only family they have known or have left, so the kinship felt between members of an order is a bond neigh unbreakable.</p>\n<p>Beyond the boundaries of the order, however, the life of a blood hunter is often not an easy one. The rituals of the Hunter&rsquo;s Bane regularly leave one visibly changed and prone to unsettle common folk, and the witnessing of hemocraft can invoke a superstitious fear from even the most learned scholar. While some societies have come to accept the good deeds of the orders, many blood hunters publicly hide their nature unless absolutely necessary, feeling more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world where the Orders commonly train. Even so, the best work a blood hunter can do usually involves the poor and defenseless on the outskirts of society, those prone to the corrupting touch of fiends and dark intension. Braving the threat of vilification, these dark protectors wade through civilization, earning coin as mercenaries or bounty hunters, ever watching for the signs of something more nefarious beneath the surface.</p>\n<p>In choosing this path, a blood hunter has irrevocably given a part of themselves to their cause, physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. The orders of blood hunters practice their own unique ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of these guardians. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle, so a life of discipline and vigilance drives their travels as they wander the countryside in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CREATING A BLOOD HUNTER</h3>\n<p>As you create a blood hunter, the most important aspects of your character are why you were driven to this lifestyle, and why do you seek to give up everything to wallow in the dark with the evils you hunt? Did you lose a loved one to a fiendish beast and now wish to prevent others from suffering the same fate? Do you seek a sense of purpose and security, and found this among the order that has taken you in? Have you always carried a seed of darkness within you, and seek kin to watch over you and prevent you succumbing to it? Were you once a holy warrior who strayed from his faith and was cast out, but still seek to give yourself to the cause of protecting the innocent? Or are you a criminal with a dark past seeking to make amends, taking this life as a path of penance?</p>\n<p>What is your relationship with the powers of hemocraft and the abilities it promises to grant you as you step closer to its mastery? Do you respect and fear the ancient power that surges through your veins, using them only when necessary? Do you relish in the strength it offers you, embracing your gifts and using them freely? Are you worried the superstitions are right, and this power will eventually turn you into one of the monsters you hunt? Or has your study instilled you with the confident control of mind over matter, certain you can bend these gifts to bring a brighter dawn?</p>\n<p>Consider too that while a blood hunter belongs to an order, many strike out on their own to do their best work. What made you leave the comfort of your order? Do you intend to return, or have you decided you have more to learn in the world beyond? What do you seek in other adventurers that can help you meet your goals?</p>\n<p>While most blood hunters follow a path of good or neutrality in their pursuits, some have fallen to the dark, seductive side of hemocraft and use their abilities for selfish and evil purposes. These deviants are always thrown from the order, and often hunted along with the creatures they once trained to fell.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">HIT POINTS</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per blood hunter level<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per blood hunter level after 1st</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">PROFICIENCIES</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px; box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, Martial weapons, Firearms<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tools:</strong> Alchemist&rsquo;s Supplies<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Skills:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Choose three from Athletics, Acrobatics, Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Religion, and </span></span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Survival</span></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">EQUIPMENT</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">A martial weapon or two simple weapons</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">A light crossbow and 20 bolts or hand crossbow and 20 bolts</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Studded leather armor or scale armor</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">An explorer&rsquo;s pack</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>HUNTER'S BANE</strong></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the Hunter&rsquo;s Bane, a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life&rsquo;s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it.

The bag shudders as she completes her work, and a sudden, loud pop echoes through the room as a portal to an extradimensional space springs to being in the bag&rsquo;s interior. She beams with pride at her newly crafted bag of holding. A troll growls in hunger as it looms over a dwarf, who slides a long, metal tube from a holster at his belt. With a thunderous roar, a gout of flame erupts from the tube, and the troll&rsquo;s growls turn into shrieks of panic as it turns to flee. An elf scrambles up the castle&rsquo;s wall, Baron von Hendriks&rsquo; men close behind her. As she clambers over the battlements, she reaches into her satchel, pulls out three vials, mixes their contents into a small leather bag, and flings it at her pursuers. The bag bursts at their feet, trapping them in a thick, black glue as she makes her escape. Makers of magic-infused objects, artificers are defined by their inventive nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of study and investigation. Artificers, though, focus on creating marvelous new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and temporary for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft durable, useful items.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CUNNING INVENTORS</h3>\n<p>Every artificer is defined by a specific craft. Artificers see mastering the basic methods of a craft as the first step to true progress, the invention of new methods and approaches. Some artificers are engineers, students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms that they can augment with magic. Other artificers are alchemists. Using their knowledge of magic and various exotic ingredients, they create potions and draughts to aid them on their adventures. Alchemy and engineering are the two most common areas of study for artificers, but others do exist. All artificers are united by their curiosity and inventive nature. To an artificer, magic is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year. Artificers value novelty and discovery. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure. A hidden ruin might hold a forgotten magic item or a beautifully crafted mirror perfect for magical enhancement. Artificers win respect and renown among their kind by uncovering new lore or inventing new methods of creation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>INTENSE RIVALRIES</h3>\n<p>The artificers&rsquo; drive to invent and expand their knowledge creates an intense drive to uncover new magic discoveries. An artificer who hears news of a newly discovered magic item must act fast to get it before any rivals do. Good-aligned artificers recover items on adventures or offer gold or wondrous items to those who possess items they are keen to own. Evil ones have no problem committing crimes to claim what they want. Almost every artificer has at least one rival, someone whom they seek to outdo at every turn. By the same token, artificers with similar philosophies and theories band together into loose guilds. They share their discoveries and work together to verify their theories and keep ahead of their rivals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CREATING AN ARTIFICER</h3>\n<p>When creating an artificer character, think about your character&rsquo;s background and drive for adventure. Does the character have a rival? What is the character&rsquo;s relationship with the artisan or artificer who taught the basics of the craft? Talk to your DM about the role played by artificers in the campaign, and what sort of organizations and NPCs you might have ties to.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong>HIT POINTS</strong></h3>\n<p><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Dice:</strong>&nbsp;1d8 per artificer level<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;8 + your Constitution modifier<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong>&nbsp;1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong>PROFICIENCIES</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Armor:</strong>&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Weapons:</strong>&nbsp;Simple weapons, Hand Crossbows, Heavy Crossbows, Firearms<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tools:</strong>&nbsp;Thieves' Tools, Tinker Tools, and two others of your choice.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Saving Throws:</strong>&nbsp;Constitution, Intelligence<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Skills:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Choose three from Arcana, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Religion, Sleight </span></span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">of Hand.</span></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong>EQUIPMENT</strong></h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Light crossbow and 20 bolts or any two simple weapons</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Scale mail, leather armor, or chain mail</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Thieves' tools and Dungeoneer's Pack</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ARTIFICER'S SPECIALIZATION</strong></h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You focus your craft on a particular specialization: Gadgetsmith, Potionsmith, Thundersmith, or</p>\n<p>Warsmith each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 5th, and 14th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>MAGIC ITEM ANALYSIS</strong></h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your understanding of magic items allows you to analyze and understand their secrets. You know the artificer spells Detect Magic and Identify, and you can cast them as rituals without material components.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>TOOL EXPERTISE</strong></h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses any of the tool proficiencies you gain from this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ARCANE RETROFIT</strong></h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Additionally, at 2nd level, you gain the ability to retrofit magical gear. During a long rest you can perform a ritual using any +1/2/3 weapon (excluding artifacts and sentient weapons) to transfer the magic into an artificer weapon (a weapon created by subclass feature or upgrade). E.g.: you can turn a +1 longsword and your impact gauntlet into a +1 impact gauntlet. This includes weapon-like Upgrades that make attack and damage rolls (like a Warsmith's Force Blast).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You cannot transfer any properties from a magical weapon besides a bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the original weapon is destroyed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can convert a set of armor with a magical plus to AC to a lighter armor type.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>SPELLCASTING</strong></h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>As part of your study of magic, you gain the ability to cast spells at 3rd level. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned with modifying creatures and objects or creating items.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELL SLOTS</strong></h3>\n<p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells you must expend a slot of their spells level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER</strong></h3>\n<p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Artificer spell list. The spells known column of the Artificer table shows when you learn more artificer spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Artificer table.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the artificer spells you know from this feature and replace it with another spell from the artificer spell list. The new spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots on the artificer table.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</strong></h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence Modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you can cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Save DC</strong> = 8 + Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Intelligence Modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Attack Modifier </strong>= Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Intelligence Modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>SPECIALIZATION UPGRADE</strong></h2>\n<p><em>3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your expert craftsmanship allows you to improve, modify, or add to your specialization's features.</p>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, choose an upgrade from the list at the end of your specialization, and gain the benefits listed in the description of the Upgrade.</p>\n<p>You select an additional Upgrade at 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th level. You cannot select an Upgrade more than once, unless the Upgrade's description says otherwise. Whenever you level up, you can exchange one of your existing upgrades for another upgrade of the same level requirement as the replaced upgrade.</p>\n<p>In any case that a specialization allows an Upgrade to be swapped out, Upgrades must always be selected as if the Artificer is the level they were when they got that Upgrade slot. For example, if you replace your Stormforged Weapon and reselect all of your upgrades as a 5th level Artificer, you could select one 3rd level upgrade and one 5th level upgrade, or two 3rd level upgrades, but you would not be able to select two 5th level upgrades.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT</strong></h2>\n<p><em>4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 18th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 18th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>You can also replace one of your skill proficiencies with a skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level (the proficiency you replace needn&rsquo;t be from the class). This represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ARCANE RECONSTRUCTION</strong></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You have mastered the knowledge of using magic to repair things. You learn the mending cantrip and can cast it at will. Additionally, you learn the cure wounds spell. If you already know cure wounds, you can select another spell from the artificer list. When you cast cure wounds, it can heal constructs in addition to normally valid targets.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>CROSS DISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE</strong></h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You can expand on your knowledge across fields. You can craft one of the following: a Thundersmith's Stormforged Weapon, a Potionsmith's Alchemical Reagent Pouch and Alchemical Fire or Alchemical Acid, or an Unrestricted Gadgetsmith Upgrade.</p>\n<p>If you select a Stormforged Weapon, you gain proficiency with that weapon and knowledge of how to make ammunition for it (if required). You cannot apply Infused Weapon to another weapon granted by this class.</p>\n<p>If this selection is lost or destroyed, you can remake it following the rules for remaking the select item in subclass.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>WONDROUS ITEM PROFICIENCY</strong></h2>\n<p><em>7th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your familiarity with the workings of magical items means that you can ignore class-based restrictions on attuning to magical items. Additionally, you can now attune to 4 magical items at once.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>IMPROVED MAGICAL CRAFTING</strong></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your experience in creating your own wondrous invention makes you more adept at crafting a magic item than a normal spellcaster. Creating a magic item takes you half the time it would normally take.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can make 1 hour of progress toward crafting a magic item, scroll, or potion during a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>WONDROUS ITEM RECHARGE</strong></h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You can recharge a magic item that has charges or per rest uses, as long as those charges or uses can only be used to cast spells. To restore charges or uses, you perform a ritual that takes one minute and expends a spell slot of equal or higher level than a spell slot level of a spell cast by the item.</p>\n<p>The number of charges or uses restored to the item is equal to the number of charges or uses required to cast that spell using the item once.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>STUDY OF MAGIC</strong></h2>\n<p><em>11th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your proficiency in the workings of magic has become so great you can cast detect magic and identify at will without expending a spell slot.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks to understand the workings of magical traps, effects, or runes.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>WONDROUS ITEMS MASTERY</strong></h2>\n<p><em>18th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>You can activate a magic item that would normally take an action as a bonus action instead.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can attune to 5 magical items at a time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>PEERLESS INVENTOR</strong></h2>\n<p><em>20th-level Artificer feature</em></p>\n<p>At 20th level, your mind is always thinking of new options and clever solutions. You can select and create temporary version of an Upgrade from your subclass you are qualified to take but do not have with a level requirement of 11th level or lower as an action. You have this upgrade until you complete a short rest. You cannot select another temporary Upgrade in this fashion until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Artificer's Specialization</h1>\n<h2>Gadgetsmith</h2>\n<p>A Gadgetsmith is an Artificer whose curiosity and inventive genius have run rampant. While other Artificers may spend their whole career perfecting a single-minded pursuit, a Gadgetsmith believes that quantity is at least as good as quality.</p>\n<p>Quick footed and quicker witted, a Gadgetsmith is never caught without another trick up their sleeve. Their minds are always jumping ahead to solve the next problem with a clever gadget.</p>\n<p>A Gadgetsmith can come from any walk of life, but usually exemplifies a curiosity and distaste for the suppression of knowledge or technology, usually favoring freedom to experiment, leaning toward more Chaotic behaviors.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>GADGETSMITH'S PROFICIENCY</strong></h3>\n<p><em>1st-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with nets, rapiers, whips, and tinker's tools.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>ESSENTIAL TOOLS</strong></h3>\n<p><em>1st-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>You've mastered the creation of the essential reusable tools for surviving the battlefield as a gadgeteer. You have the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grappling Hook. As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or Smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it. Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it, however, this does not grapple it. Attacks of opportunity generated by this movement have disadvantage.</li>\n<li>Smoke Bomb. As an action, you can use this to cast fog cloud centered on yourself without expending a spell slot. It lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and does not require concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can set the radius at 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier per short rest.</li>\n<li>Gadgetsmith Weapon. Pick one of Impact Gauntlets, Lightning Baton, Repeating Crossbow, Ricocheting Weapon, or Shock Generator from the upgrade section. You receive this upgrade and it does not count against your upgrade total.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>ADDITIONAL UPGRADE</strong></h3>\n<p><em>3rd-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you've mastered the essential tools, and have begun to tinker with ways to expand your arsenal. The number of upgrades you have for your class level is increased by one.</p>\n<p>The number of additional upgrades you get increases by one more at 5th level to two more than the class table.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>RECYCLE GADGETS</strong></h3>\n<p><em>3rd-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>During a long rest and taking effect when you complete it, you can disassemble your gadgets and create different ones. When you do this, remove any upgrade you would like, and pick a new upgrade its place.</p>\n<p>You still must select upgrades that are valid for the level you gained the upgrade at (e.g. at 9th level, you can only have one upgrade that has a prerequisite of 9th level).</p>\n<p>Additionally, if a gadget is destroyed, you can use this feature to recreate it for materials worth 20 gold pieces.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>EXTRA ATTACK</strong></h3>\n<p><em>5th-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>COMBAT GADGETS</strong></h3>\n<p><em>14th-level Gadgetsmith feature</em></p>\n<p>When you take the attack action, you can replace an attack with using any gadget that requires an action to use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LAEn6ZdC6lYUKhQ67Qk","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":3,"choices":[],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"half"},"flags":{},"img":"modules/foundry-shared-data/Images/artificer-icon.png","effects":[]}
{"name":"Swordmage","permission":{"default":0,"EwniMIlnxy7gRcHL":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The halfling thief looks around as an ogre finds its hiding spot. As the ogre slams its club down, a swordsman appears with a flash of blue light to block the club with his glowing sword. Between him and his halfling friend, they easily dispatch the surprised ogre. The mighty dragon breathes fire at the intruder, but the lightly armored elf smiles unconcerned. She strides through the fire, a redish, magical barrier protecting her from the worst of the flames. The shocked dragon has little time to react to the impossibly alive elf before her blade starts cutting through the dragon's scales. As the bandit's blade threatens to cut the pale warrior in half, the warrior simply twists his hand and mutters an arcane word of power. The bandit cries out in pain as his sword arm suddenly stops in place. With a chilling smile, the warrior plunges his blade into the bandit savoring the warmth of vitality gained from the bandit's blood. All these magical warriors are swordmages, combatants that blend magic and martial might. Regardless of a swordmage's magical specialization, magic is crucial to a swordmage. Unlike more mundane warriors, sword mages rely on magic to boost their defensive and offensive capabilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BLADE</h3>\n<p>Swordmages spend as much time learning magic as they do practicing their bladework. The synthesis of these dual studies is represented by a swordmage's weapon, which through magical bonding becomes the conduit of a swordmage's magic. As a wizard records their spell knowledge in a spellbook, a swordmage inscribes their magical knowledge as glyphs onto their bonded weapon. Since a swordmage's bonded weapon is not only their tool in combat, but also their source of magic, swordmages treat this weapon with the utmost care. Although the name implies sword wielders, some swordmages choose other weapons such as axes, spears, or flails.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>TIMELESS TRADITION</h3>\n<p>Some say the swordmage tradition started with the elves who once sought to create guardians against a forgotten darkness. Others speak of the magical warriors of fearsome githyanki that terrorize the Astral Sea. Regardless of the tradition's origins, the path of the swordmage entices those ambitious enough to focus on two opposing arts: swordplay and magic. As the swordmage tradition has grown in popularity, many beyond elves and githyanki have chosen this ambitious practice. Some swordmages were once simple warriors that after witnessing the wonders of devastation of the arcane, then decided to incorporate magic into their fighting style. Other swordmages were once apprentice mages that after a formative event, then realized magic was not enough to survive and achieve their ambitions. Either way, a swordmage requires a dedicated mind and body. One must seek new knowledge but also practice martial excellence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CREATING A SWORDMAGE</h3>\n<p>As you build your swordmage, carefully consider two elements of your character's background: Where were they trained and what weapon will they bond with? Some large cities, especially among more magical cultures such as the elves, might have institutions that train aspiring swordmages. Perhaps you were a trained soldier chosen for your intelligence to learn magic in order to help your cause win a war. Maybe you apprenticed with a swordmage mentor who taught you all they knew and you are now striking out on your own. Furthermore, how does your swordmage fight? The weapon you bond with is an important choice. Was the weapon a family heirloom or perhaps passed down from the master that taught you everything you know? Or did you earn this weapon in combat and it represents your first victory?</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">HIT POINTS</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per swordmage level<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;8 + your Constitution modifier<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per swordmage level after 1st</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">PROFICIENCIES</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px; box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Armor:</strong>&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tools:</strong> None<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Saving Throws:</strong>&nbsp;Constitution, Intelligence<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Skills:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px; box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">C</span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">hoose two from Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, History, Insight, and Investigation.</span></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">EQUIPMENT</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Two martial weapons or a longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">A scholar&rsquo;s pack or an explorer&rsquo;s pack</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Scale mail or leather armor</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ARCANE WEAPON</strong></h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Swordmage feature</em></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn a ritual that magically transforms one weapon into your magical conduit. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and transform it into your Arcane Weapon. The chosen weapon becomes your spellcasting focus for your swordmage spells.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your Arcane Weapon is within a mile of you, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</li>\n<li>If your Arcane Weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour to magically repair the weapon.</li>\n<li>If your Arcane Weapon lacks the two-handed property, and you are wielding it in one hand with another hand free, then you gain a magical +1 bonus to your AC. If you use two hands to make an attack with your Arcane Weapon, then you lose this magical bonus until the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you attempt to bond with another weapon, you must break the bond with your current Arcane</p>\n<p>Weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>SPELLCASTING</strong></h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Swordmage feature</em></p>\n<p>You've studied the battle application of magic and inscribe your chosen weapon with a handful of spells to augment your fighting style. You channel your magic through your Arcane Weapon, which appears to others as if you're producing magical wonders as you fight.</p>\n<h3><strong>WEAPON REQUIRED</strong></h3>\n<p>You produce your swordmage spell effects through your blade. You must have a spellcasting focusspecifically your Arcane Weapon or another weapon-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has a \"M\" component when you cast it).</p>\n<h3><strong>CANTRIPS (0-LEVEL SPELLS)</strong></h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the swordmage spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional swordmage cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the swordmage table. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the swordmage cantrips you know with another cantrip from the swordmage spell list.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELL SLOTS</strong></h3>\n<p>The Swordmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your swordmage spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these swordmage spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</strong></h3>\n<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the swordmage spell list. The Spells Known column of the Swordmage table shows when you learn more swordmage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the swordmage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the swordmage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</strong></h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your swordmage spells, since your magic reflects your arcane studies. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a swordmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use your Arcane Weapon as your spellcasting focus for swordmage spells. See chapter 10 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ARCANE STEP</strong></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you can teleport around the battlefield. As a bonus action, you can teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

{"_id":"Eewlax3t0PWIAqfD","name":"Swordmage","permission":{"default":0,"EwniMIlnxy7gRcHL":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The halfling thief looks around as an ogre finds its hiding spot. As the ogre slams its club down, a swordsman appears with a flash of blue light to block the club with his glowing sword. Between him and his halfling friend, they easily dispatch the surprised ogre. The mighty dragon breathes fire at the intruder, but the lightly armored elf smiles unconcerned. She strides through the fire, a redish, magical barrier protecting her from the worst of the flames. The shocked dragon has little time to react to the impossibly alive elf before her blade starts cutting through the dragon's scales. As the bandit's blade threatens to cut the pale warrior in half, the warrior simply twists his hand and mutters an arcane word of power. The bandit cries out in pain as his sword arm suddenly stops in place. With a chilling smile, the warrior plunges his blade into the bandit savoring the warmth of vitality gained from the bandit's blood. All these magical warriors are swordmages, combatants that blend magic and martial might. Regardless of a swordmage's magical specialization, magic is crucial to a swordmage. Unlike more mundane warriors, sword mages rely on magic to boost their defensive and offensive capabilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BLADE</h3>\n<p>Swordmages spend as much time learning magic as they do practicing their bladework. The synthesis of these dual studies is represented by a swordmage's weapon, which through magical bonding becomes the conduit of a swordmage's magic. As a wizard records their spell knowledge in a spellbook, a swordmage inscribes their magical knowledge as glyphs onto their bonded weapon. Since a swordmage's bonded weapon is not only their tool in combat, but also their source of magic, swordmages treat this weapon with the utmost care. Although the name implies sword wielders, some swordmages choose other weapons such as axes, spears, or flails.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>TIMELESS TRADITION</h3>\n<p>Some say the swordmage tradition started with the elves who once sought to create guardians against a forgotten darkness. Others speak of the magical warriors of fearsome githyanki that terrorize the Astral Sea. Regardless of the tradition's origins, the path of the swordmage entices those ambitious enough to focus on two opposing arts: swordplay and magic. As the swordmage tradition has grown in popularity, many beyond elves and githyanki have chosen this ambitious practice. Some swordmages were once simple warriors that after witnessing the wonders of devastation of the arcane, then decided to incorporate magic into their fighting style. Other swordmages were once apprentice mages that after a formative event, then realized magic was not enough to survive and achieve their ambitions. Either way, a swordmage requires a dedicated mind and body. One must seek new knowledge but also practice martial excellence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CREATING A SWORDMAGE</h3>\n<p>As you build your swordmage, carefully consider two elements of your character's background: Where were they trained and what weapon will they bond with? Some large cities, especially among more magical cultures such as the elves, might have institutions that train aspiring swordmages. Perhaps you were a trained soldier chosen for your intelligence to learn magic in order to help your cause win a war. Maybe you apprenticed with a swordmage mentor who taught you all they knew and you are now striking out on your own. Furthermore, how does your swordmage fight? The weapon you bond with is an important choice. Was the weapon a family heirloom or perhaps passed down from the master that taught you everything you know? Or did you earn this weapon in combat and it represents your first victory?</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">HIT POINTS</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per swordmage level<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;8 + your Constitution modifier<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per swordmage level after 1st</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">PROFICIENCIES</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px; box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Armor:</strong>&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tools:</strong> None<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Saving Throws:</strong>&nbsp;Constitution, Intelligence<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Skills:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #191813; font-size: 13px; box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">C</span><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">hoose two from Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, History, Insight, and Investigation.</span></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">EQUIPMENT</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Two martial weapons or a longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">A scholar&rsquo;s pack or an explorer&rsquo;s pack</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Scale mail or leather armor</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>ARCANE WEAPON</strong></h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Swordmage feature</em></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn a ritual that magically transforms one weapon into your magical conduit. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and transform it into your Arcane Weapon. The chosen weapon becomes your spellcasting focus for your swordmage spells.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your Arcane Weapon is within a mile of you, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</li>\n<li>If your Arcane Weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour to magically repair the weapon.</li>\n<li>If your Arcane Weapon lacks the two-handed property, and you are wielding it in one hand with another hand free, then you gain a magical +1 bonus to your AC.

You channel your magic through your Arcane Weapon, which appears to others as if you're producing magical wonders as you fight.</p>\n<h3><strong>WEAPON REQUIRED</strong></h3>\n<p>You produce your swordmage spell effects through your blade. You must have a spellcasting focusspecifically your Arcane Weapon or another weapon-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has a \"M\" component when you cast it).</p>\n<h3><strong>CANTRIPS (0-LEVEL SPELLS)</strong></h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the swordmage spell list.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the swordmage cantrips you know with another cantrip from the swordmage spell list.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELL SLOTS</strong></h3>\n<p>The Swordmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your swordmage spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these swordmage spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</strong></h3>\n<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the swordmage spell list.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the swordmage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the swordmage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</strong></h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your swordmage spells, since your magic reflects your arcane studies. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a swordmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h3><strong>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use your Arcane Weapon as your spellcasting focus for swordmage spells.
